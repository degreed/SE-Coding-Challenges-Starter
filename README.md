# Welcome to the Front End Code Challenge

We are so excited you want to join Degreed as a front end engineer!

For your code challenge, we have a small application prepared.

- Our code challenge does NOT expect you to start from scratch.
- The application has been deliberately broken and actually contains bad code; code that we would not accept within Degreed.
- This challenge should take you no more than 2-4 hours to complete.

We want you to succeed and show us what you can do!

## The Code Challenge

![An illustration of the expected Movie Search app. It shows a list of Batman movies in a particular design.](https://github.com/ThomasBurleson/movie-search-rsm-react/assets/210413/4970a267-7c97-4bd0-abbb-69dcada13ba4)

- Repair our web application code so that it runs and matches the design above.
- Be sure to fix any other bugs or issues you see. [Don't forget about accessibility!](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)
  - Extra credit: add or update unit tests.
- As a final step, imagine you've been asked to refactor this small application into something that could function at scale. Create a map (graphical, HTML, ASCHII, in words — your choice!) for changes you'd make to the structure and add that to the README. Go as big as you want, really have fun with it — just be prepared to explain your suggestions!

> Your solution **must** be your own, created without help and not copied from another source.

### The Challenge Process

1. Fork this repo.
2. Once your solution for our **MovieSearch** application is complete, create a Pull Request.
   > Your PR should be in your own repo. Do NOT create a PR against Degreed's repo!
3. One or more developers will perform a private Code Review of your PR.
4. If your solution passes, you will proceed to the technical interview.

- Be prepared to explain your changes and the map you created.
- Your interviewers will want to know the **whys**, the **impacts**, and the **tradeoffs** for both your changes and your _proposed_ changes.

5. The interviewers will evaluate both your submission _and_ your participation in the Code Review process.

Don't worry, we don't expect perfect code! We only hope to see results equivalent to the role you are applying for.

We want to assess your **skills**, **knowledge**, and **creativity**... as well as your ability to _communicate_ and _collaborate_.

This challenge is **both** a technical and non-technical test.

## Let's Go!

Ready to get started? Fork this repo and get to work! We look forward to hearing from you.
