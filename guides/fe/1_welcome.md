## The Code Challenge In a Nutshell

- Repair our web application code so that it runs.
- Be sure to fix any other bugs or issues you see. [Don't forget about accessibility!](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)
  - Extra credit: add or update unit tests.
- As a final step, imagine you've been asked to refactor this small application into something that could function at scale. Create a map (graphical, HTML, ASCHII, in words — your choice!) for changes you'd make to the structure and add that to the README. Go as big as you want, really have fun with it — just be prepared to explain your suggestions!

> Your solution **must** be your own, created without help and not copied from another source.


### The Challenge Process

1. Once your solution for our **MovieSearch** application is complete, create a Pull Request.
2. One or more developers will perform a private Code Review of your PR.
3. If your solution passes, you will proceed to the technical interview.
  - Be prepared to disucss your changes and the map you created.
  - Your interviewers will want to know the **whys**, the **impacts**, and the **tradeoffs** for both your changes and your _proposed_ changes.
4. The interviewers will evaluate both your submission _and_ your participation in the Code Review process.

Don't worry, we don't expect perfect code! We only hope to see results equivalent to the role you are applying for.

We want to assess your **skills**, **knowledge**, and **creativity**... as well as your ability to _communicate_ and _collaborate_.

This challenge is **both** a technical and non-technical test.
